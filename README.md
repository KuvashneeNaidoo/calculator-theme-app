## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with object key-value pairs in JavaScript, particularly in the context of managing themes with custom CSS properties. This method allowed me to dynamically switch between different visual themes on a webpage.

```css
.reset-btn {
  background-color: var(--reset-btn-bg);
  box-shadow: 0px 5px var(--reset-btn-shadow);
}
```

```js
const theme1 = {
  "--reset-btn-bg": "hsl(225, 21%, 49%)",
  "--reset-btn-shadow": "hsl(224, 28%, 35%)",
};

function applyTheme(theme) {
  Object.keys(theme).forEach((key) => {
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty(key, theme[key]);
  });
}
```

### Continued development

I am yet to implement the bonus challenge where the theme preference is checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and any additional theme changes are saved in the browser (so they persist between sessions). I will make use of localStorage to store and retrieve the userâ€™s theme choice.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Webkit Slider Thumb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-slider-thumb) - I used this CSS pseudo-element to style the slider thumb that users interact with to adjust the value of a <input> element with type="range."
